A.
Our two added features will be 
	1) Choose what countries are graphed: the program starts with displaying window "Country options"
	 with the checkbox for each possible country from the file, a vertical scroll bar and submit button in it. 
	 The options are the country names from the given excel file.
	 By checking countries and clicking "submit" user triggers new window displaying "Cellular Graph" that contains
	 a GraphOverOver panel and a Legend panel. The panels display information about countries chosen in checkbox.
	
	2) When the user hovers over any point plotted for a country, the data (year,subscriptions) will be displayed
	   to the right of that point
	   
The user will become aware of the two features in this way:

	1) The user will be prompted to check the countries he/she wants before the program proceeds
	2) A prompt "Hover over any point to see data values" will appear at the top left of the graph
	   until the first mouse movement is detected in the panel
	   
The classes will be named:
	GraphHoverOver.java - creates the graph panel and tracks mouse movements
	SelectionBox.java - shows the list of countries and allows user to check which ones should be graphed
	
	
StoryBoard:

See feature1.jpg
A vertically scrollable pane with the list of countries with a checkbox next to each.
A submit button will be pressed by the user, the pane will disappear and the program will plot the selected countries.

See feature2.jpg

(1) when the mouse is not touching or clicking any points, there is no data displayed
(2) when the mouse moves towards a plotted point or clicks near a plotted point (within DISTANCE pixels) the data label is displayed
(3) when the mouse leaves the area which is DISTANCE pixels from the point, the data label disappears
